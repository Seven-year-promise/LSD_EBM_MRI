The overall architecture of the LSD-EBM is visualized in the figure. Given an input 3D image $\mathbf{x}$, the inference network generates the latent variable $\mathbf{z}_0 \sim q_\varphi(\mathbf{z}_0|\mathbf{x})= \mathcal{N}(\mathbf{z};\mu_0(x),\sigma_0(x))$ with learnable mean $\mu_0$ and variance $\sigma_0$. A latent diffusion and denoising processes are constructed with the energy-based prior to optimize $\mathbf{z}_0$. The diffusion in latent space acts as checkpoints guiding the learning while also reducing its computational overhead which would be prohibitive in full image space, therefore resulting in more stable and accurate generation. The optimized $\mathbf{z}_0$ is then used by the generation network to reconstruct the 3D image $\mathbf{x}^\prime \sim p_\beta(\mathbf{x}|\mathbf{z}_0)$.

Our work is accepted by 4th MICCAI Workshop, DGM4MICCAI 2024, which will be Held in Conjunction with MICCAI 2024, Marrakesh, Morocco, October 10, 2024. Feel free to contact and have discussions during the event.


## <div align="center">Documentation</div>

LSD-EBM ðŸš€ is based on a latent space diffusion energy-based prior to leverage diffusion models, which exhibit high-quality image generation for both in 2D and 3D formats. The performance of the those models are tested on the 2D public datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, and CelebA), and our domestic vertebrae datasets (3D). 

We hope that this work will help the researchers and engineers in image generation or out-painting for MRI imaging. 

To request an access to the mentioned MRI dataset in the article, please free to contact us.
