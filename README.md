## A high-resolution MRI vertebrae reconstruction pipeline (GeMRI) 

### Introduction

This code contains the implementation of EBM, LEBM, and our LSD-EBM. The performance of the those models are tested on the public datasets (2D), and our domestic vertebrae datasets (3D).


### Installation

The virtual environment in `ve_py37_ebm.yml` is used for EBM and LEBM. 

`conda env create -f ve_py37_ebm.yml`

`python ebm_mnist.py`

The virtual environment in `ve_py37_lsd_ebm.yml` is used for LSD_EBM.
